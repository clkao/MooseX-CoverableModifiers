NAME
    MooseX::CoverableModifiers - Make Moose method modifiers Devel::Cover
    friendly

SYNOPSIS
      use Moose;
      use MooseX::CoverableModifiers;

      after foo => sub {
         # this sub is now coverable by Devel::Cover
         # it is actually translated into:
         #   after foo => \&after_foo_0; *after_foo_0 = sub {
      };

DESCRIPTION
    Method modifiers are handy, but they are not Devel::Cover friendly. This
    is because Perl makes package-level anonymous subroutines invisible to
    Devel::Cover, and the modifiers are often anonymous subroutines.

    MooseX::CoverableModifiers names the subroutines with Devel::Declare, so
    they can be seen by Devel::Cover and take parts in you coverage reports.

    The module has no effects unless Devel::Cover is loaded.

TODO
    Some magic tool that uses MooseX::CoverableModifiers for all Moose
    classes when you run tests, so you don't even have to explicitly use the
    module.
